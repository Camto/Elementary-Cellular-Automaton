# Elementary-Cellular-Automaton
The elementary cellular automaton (a.k.a Rule 110) is a 1 dimensional cellular automaton (this program uses the second dimension to represent **time**).
To use it download the .zip file unzip it, and inside it, you'll find `Rules.html`. Open it, and a window will popup asking `Rule?`, the answer is any number between _0_ and _255_ (_110_ and _73_ are my favorite), then another popup will appear asking for the world size, 40 is usually good for any computer. Now sit back and watch!
